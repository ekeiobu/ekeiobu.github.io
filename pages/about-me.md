    Hi, I’m Ekei Obu, a passionate and creative strategist from Nigeria, currently pursuing a degree in Multimedia
Journalism at Morgan State University. With a deep love for media and event coordination, I specialize in
combining innovative ideas with strategic execution to create impactful, engaging experiences. My journey has
been shaped by my desire to connect people through meaningful content, dynamic events, and purpose-driven
initiatives. At the core of all my work is my faith in Jesus, which fuels my desire to bring people together and
inspire positive change.
