what_i_learned: |
  Today, we continued analyzing different types of ECGs, comparing normal, abnormal, and those with myocardial infarction or history of MI. We read several articles on ECG denoising techniques, learning about methods like 
  wavelet transforms, filtering, and machine learning approaches. Using this knowledge, we each wrote our own Python code to denoise ECG signals. Tomorrow, we’ll run and compare our codes to evaluate their effectiveness 
  and refine them based on the results.

 Today helped me understand ECGs better by looking at different types, like normal, abnormal, and those with heart problems. Reading articles about how to clean up ECG signals showed me how important it is to remove noise 
 for clear results. I wrote my own code to try one of the methods I learned, which made me think and apply what I read. I’m excited for tomorrow when we test and compare everyone’s code. This is a good way for me to learn 
 more and improve my skills.
