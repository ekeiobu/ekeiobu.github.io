what_i_learned: |
  Today, we learned more about the Python programming language and its built-in functions. We also explored the if statement, which is used to control the flow of a program. When an if statement is used, Python checks whether 
  the given condition is True or False. If the condition is True, the code inside the block runs. This allows us to create logic-based decisions in our programs.ion, we focused on Python, used variables, practiced type 
  casting, and created a digital profile using variables. We also learned how to identify different objects and things in an image using code.
