  Computer Vision Workshop with Andrew Kelly

  In this workshop, we learned how to identify objects using Teachable Machine by creating classifications. We used it to train the model to recognize different objects.

  Python Coding Session with Clyde

    In a different session, we focused on Python, used variables, practiced type casting, and created a digital profile using variables. We also learned how to identify different objects and things in an image using code.
