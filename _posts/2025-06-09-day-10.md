what_i_learned: |
 Today, our team had a meeting where we discussed our project goals and divided tasks under the direction of our professor. I was assigned to begin writing the research paper, focusing on several key sections. These include 
 the introduction, where I will discuss the use of machine learning to classify cardiovascular diseases (CVD), and the motivation, which addresses how misdiagnoses can lead to death and why accurate detection is crucial. I’ll 
 also write about the goal of our study—building a machine learning system that can accurately detect CVD from ECG data—as well as the hypothesis, which proposes that the model can predict, detect, and explain CVD more 
 effectively than traditional approaches. Additionally, I’ll outline our contribution to science and conduct a literature review to examine previous studies, their methods, and results.

reflection: |
 Reflecting on today's meeting and my assigned tasks, I feel both challenged and motivated. Taking responsibility for the initial sections of the research paper is a significant step, especially since it involves 
 understanding complex topics like machine learning and its application to cardiovascular disease detection. Although I’m not a computer science major, I’m eager to learn and contribute meaningfully to the project. Writing 
 the introduction, motivation, and literature review will require me to dive deep into existing research and think critically about how our work fits into the broader scientific conversation. This experience is already 
 pushing me to improve my research and writing skills, and I’m excited to see how our project develops.
