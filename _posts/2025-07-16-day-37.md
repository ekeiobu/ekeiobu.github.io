what_i_learned: |
 For today’s blog post, our team had a meeting with DC Mack and Michael, where we discussed some of the challenges we've been facing. This made me realize that, as a group, we haven’t been communicating as effectively as we    should, especially when it comes to updating each other on our accomplishments, the specific progress we’ve made, and how that progress aligns with the group’s overall goals. From this discussion, I learned that we can        improve our communication by regularly sharing daily updates on our progress and achievements.f our writing to improve the overall flow and clarity. This involved reorganizing some sections to better align with the narrative  of our study and ensure that each part logically builds on the   previous one.


blockers: |
 One major blocker our team is facing is the lack of consistent communication and updates on individual progress. This gap makes it difficult for us to coordinate effectively, track our collective progress, and ensure that     everyone’s efforts align with our group goals. Without regular check-ins or clear communication channels, misunderstandings and delays occur, slowing down our overall progress. 

reflection: |
 Today's meeting with DC Mack and Michael was an eye-opener for me and the team. It became clear that our communication has not been as effective as it needs to be for us to reach our group goals efficiently. I realized that   without regular updates on individual progress and achievements, it’s difficult for everyone to stay aligned and motivated. This experience taught me the importance of transparent and consistent communication within a team.
