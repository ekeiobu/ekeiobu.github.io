what_i_learned: |
 Over the past few days, I explored the fascinating world of biomedical signal processing, focusing on ECG (electrocardiogram) image data. I learned that ECG images often contain noise—unwanted marks or signals that can 
 interfere with analyzing the actual heartbeat pattern. I studied different denoising techniques like Gaussian Blur, Median Filtering, and Thresholding using Python and OpenCV to fix this. These tools helped me clean up the 
 images and make the ECG lines more visible and accurate.
 
 I also learned about bandpass filters, which allow only certain frequency signals to pass through—specifically, not too low and not too high. I understood this concept by comparing it to music: just like how headphones can 
 filter out extra noise and let you hear only the vocals, a bandpass filter focuses on the useful part of the ECG signal. I applied this filter using something called the Fourier Transform, which changes the image from a 
 normal picture to a frequency format. Then, I applied a circular mask to filter the frequency and converted the image back to normal to see the cleaned result.

reflection: |
 Starting from little knowledge about signal processing, I now feel much more confident working with ECG data. At first, terms like bandpass, frequency domain, and denoising felt like a foreign language. But breaking things 
 down into simple examples, like comparing filters to music sounds or noise to birthday party distractions, helped me understand them better and made learning less intimidating.

 Writing Python code to process real ECG images gave me hands-on experience and a better grasp of how biomedical data is prepared for analysis. Although I haven’t yet seen the final output of the denoised images (since I plan 
 to run the code tomorrow), I already feel a sense of accomplishment from building the logic behind it. This process has shown me how coding and healthcare can connect in powerful ways, and I’m excited to keep learning and 
 see the results of my work in action.
