what_i_learned: |
 Today was a productive and focused day centered on academic writing, technical clarity, and report development. I refined content related to ECG signal analysis using AI, making technical explanations more concise and converting key references into BibTeX format for streamlined citation. I also crafted a paragraph explaining the importance of Explainable AI (XAI) in our model and suggested a related subtopic for deeper exploration. Additionally, I finalized improvements to both the methodology and literature review sections—tightening the narrative, removing redundancy, and ensuring a consistent, research-driven flow. To wrap up, I wrote a reflective summary highlighting how different types of noise (Gaussian, muscle, and baseline wander) affect ECG model performance, integrating insights from today's research to support our project goals.
