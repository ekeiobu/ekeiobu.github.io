what_i_learned: |
 Today, I focused on cleaning up our writing to improve clarity and flow. We also had a meeting with the Writing Center, which helped identify areas for refinement. After the meeting, I made edits based on their feedback and   continued polishing what we have so far. Overall, it was a productive day of tightening up our content.
