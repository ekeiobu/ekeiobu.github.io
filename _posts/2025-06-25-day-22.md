what_i_learned: |
  Today was all about getting ready to communicate our work in a clear and compelling way. I began preparing the presentation for our ECGNet project, organizing the content in a way that tells the story behind our research—     from the problem we’re addressing to the impact we hope to make.
  I started by outlining the main sections: project motivation, existing research, methodology, and expected outcomes. I wanted the structure to not only inform but also engage, especially for those who may not have a deep      technical background. Finding that balance between technical depth and clarity is something I’m learning in real time.
  As part of the prep, I revisited our literature review to pull out key studies that support our direction. It helped reinforce our rationale and added credibility to what we’re building. I also made notes on what visuals      would support each section—things like ECG sample images, model diagrams, and summary tables.
  There’s still more work to do, but laying down the framework today gave me momentum. Tomorrow, I’ll focus on finalizing the slides and refining the narrative flow so that we’re not just presenting data—we’re telling a story

   No major blockers today

reflection: |
   Preparing for this presentation reminded me how important it is to not just do the work but to be able to communicate it clearly. As I organized the slides, I realized that understanding the project is one thing, and          explaining it simply and confidently is another. It pushed me to think deeper about our purpose and the "why" behind every step we have taken so far. I also noticed areas where I needed to revisit certain concepts just to      make sure I could speak on them without second-guessing. Overall, the process helped me grow not just as a researcher but as a communicator.
