what_i_learned: |
  Today I spent more time reading other people’s work on AI and ECG. I focused on what each study worked on, the methods they used, and the results they got. Some used deep learning, others combined different techniques like wavelet transform and neural networks.
It’s helping me get a clearer picture of what’s already been done and what gaps are still out there. The more I read, the more I understand how our work can add something new instead of repeating what’s already out.
It’s a bit slow, but necessary. I’m learning a lot just by seeing how others structure their research and what problems they’re trying to solve.

   No major blockers today

reflection: |
   Spending time reading other people’s research today reminded me that every good project starts with understanding what’s already out there. At first, it felt repetitive, but as I read more, I started connecting ideas and      noticing patterns. I saw how different teams approached the same problem in unique ways, and that opened my mind to new possibilities.
   It also made me realize how important it is to not just build something, but to build something meaningful—something that adds value. The process is slow, but I can feel myself growing. I’m not just reading to finish—I’m      reading to understand.
