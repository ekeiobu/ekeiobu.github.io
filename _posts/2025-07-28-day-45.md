what_i_learned: |
 Today, I focused on refining two key sections of our project: the methodology and the literature review. These parts are crucial for making sure our research stands strong and clear, so I took the time to revise and restructure them carefully.

 For the methodology, I clarified our process and added more detail about how we approached the data and models. I also made sure it was easy to follow for anyone reading it—especially reviewers who might not be familiar with every technical term.

 In the literature review, I updated the structure and made the flow more logical. I connected past studies more clearly to our own work and emphasized how our research builds on and differs from previous findings. This not only strengthens our argument but also highlights the relevance of what we’re doing.
