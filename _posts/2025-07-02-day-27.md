what_i_learned: |
 Today, we focused on getting ready for our final presentation tomorrow. We started by going through a full run of the presentation as a team, making sure our transitions were smooth and everyone knew their part. After that,    we had a meeting with our professor to get feedback on both the content and our delivery.

 Based on that feedback, we made several changes to the slides—adjusting visuals, fixing wording, and clarifying some key points. It was helpful to see where we could improve, especially with time management and simplifying    complex ideas.

   No major blockers today

reflection: |
   Practicing today helped me see what parts of our presentation still need work. Getting feedback from our high school teacher made a difference. I also fixed up the slides to make them clearer and started finding more          references to back up our points. Step by step, it’s all coming together.
