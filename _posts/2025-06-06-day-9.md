what_i_learned: |
 Today, I deepened my understanding of how to work with ECG image data using Python. I practiced writing code to load and clean ECG images using basic denoising techniques like Gaussian blur and thresholding. I also learned 
 how organizing data properly at the start makes later steps much easier. It was helpful to connect these steps to real-world goals like diagnosing heart conditions, which made the technical process feel more meaningful.
 
 I also learned about bandpass filters, which allow only certain frequency signals to pass through—specifically, not too low and not too high. I understood this concept by comparing it to music: just like how headphones can 
 filter out extra noise and let you hear only the vocals, a bandpass filter focuses on the useful part of the ECG signal. I applied this filter using something called the Fourier Transform, which changes the image from a 
 normal picture to a frequency format. Then, I applied a circular mask to filter the frequency and converted the image back to normal to see the cleaned result.

  Accidentally uploaded my work to the wrong Google Slides, which caused a delay in our submission  

reflection: |
 Although I made good progress writing and preparing code, I faced a small setback when I accidentally uploaded my work to the wrong Google Slides. It reminded me how important it is to double-check where and how I’m 
 submitting things, especially when collaborating in a team. As someone who’s not a computer science major, I’m proud of how much I’m learning and applying, even when things feel new or technical. I’m starting to see how my 
 work contributes to the bigger picture of this research project.
