what_i_learned: |
  Today, I learned about AI research and how it involves teaching computers to think, learn, and solve real-world problems. We discussed independent and dependent variables—an independent variable is something you can 
  control, while a dependent variable is what you observe or measure. We also learned about RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), a tool that helps AI find information and generate responses, and robust systems, which are 
  strong and reliable even when the input is messy or unexpected.

  In our cardiovascular disease project, we talked about creating an app that can detect heart abnormalities and notify users to visit a doctor. For the first phase, we'll be comparing ECG datasets, denoising the data, and 
  applying a bandpass filter. We also looked at different ECG samples, including those from a healthy person, someone with a history of myocardial infarction (MI), and patients with irregular heartbeats.

  I'm just really excited about the opportunity of learning something new and implementing this knowledge in my career field.
