what_i_learned: |
 Today, I focused on documenting our technical progress by keeping a record of what has worked and what hasn’t in our coding process. This log helps us reflect on past decisions and avoid repeating mistakes as we refine our    approach. We also made a key adjustment by switching from the PTB-XL dataset to the MIT-BIH dataset due to issues with class imbalance. Additionally, I began searching for more supporting articles to strengthen our           literature review, especially to highlight how our method stands out from existing work. This ongoing research will help us build a stronger case for the uniqueness and effectiveness of our model

reflection: |
 Today, I realized that I work best when I have a clear understanding of what I’m doing and why it matters. When the goals and tasks are clear, I’m more focused, confident, and productive. This became evident as I documented   our coding progress and made sense of what had worked and what hadn’t. Understanding the reasoning behind our dataset change and the direction of our literature review made my contributions feel more intentional and           impactful. This reflection reminds me of the importance of clarity and direction in any collaborative project.---
