what_i_learned: |
  Today, I watched three coding videos on Udemy, which helped me understand the basics more clearly. I also started working with Anaconda to manage my Python environments and began using Jupyter Notebook to write and test my 
  code interactively. It was my first time using these tools, and I’m starting to feel more confident navigating them. The videos made it easier to understand how to run code cells, write in Markdown, and organize my 
  workspace effectively.

  Watching different videos on coding and understanding it makes me feel like anyone can learn anything
