what_i_learned: |
 Today, I started working on the Literature Review section of our research paper. My focus was to explore what has already been done in the area related to our project. I reviewed existing studies to understand the scope of 
 their work, the methods they applied, and the outcomes they reported. This helped me identify gaps in current research and gave me insight into which approaches have been most effective. The review process is helping me 
 shape the direction of our own research and build a strong foundation for our methodology.

One challenge I faced today was finding research papers that directly align with our specific project focus. While there’s a lot of information available, not all of it is relevant or detailed enough to support our direction. 
It took a lot of time to sort through and identify the most useful sources, which slowed down my progress on summarizing key findings. 

reflection: |
 Today’s task of beginning the literature review gave me a deeper appreciation for the research process. As I read through different studies, I started to see how much work has already been done in the field but also how much 
 more there is to explore. It was interesting to compare the methods used by other researchers and the results they arrived at. Some approaches were similar to what we’re considering, while others offered new ideas I hadn’t 
 thought about before.

 This process reminded me of the importance of building on existing knowledge rather than starting from scratch. It also challenged me to think critically, asking not just what they did, but why they chose certain methods and 
 how effective those decisions were. Overall, I’m learning how to better position our project within the larger research conversation and contribute something meaningful.
