what_i_learned: |
  Today at SAIRI, I continued work on our ECGNet project, focusing on strengthening the literature review. I reviewed another study that explored machine learning methods for cardiovascular disease (CVD) classification and  broke it down into what the researchers worked on, what method they used, and what results they achieved. I then tailored the summary to fit our literature review section and made sure it aligned with the format we’ve been using, with three clear paragraphs for consistency and clarity.

 blockers: |
   No major blockers today, but I did spend a bit more time refining the language to make sure it’s research-appropriate while still easy to digest. Writing for both technical audiences and general readers is a balance I’m  still learning to strike.

reflection: |
    One thing I appreciated today was seeing how different teams approach CVD detection. It reminded me that while the tools may vary—from convolutional neural networks to hybrid systems—the goal is the same: earlier, more accurate diagnosis. That reaffirmed why our project matters. This process reminded me of the importance of building on existing knowledge rather than starting from scratch. It also challenged me to think critically, asking not just what they did, but why they chose certain methods and how effective those decisions were. Overall, I’m learning how to better position our project within the larger research conversation and contribute something meaningful.
