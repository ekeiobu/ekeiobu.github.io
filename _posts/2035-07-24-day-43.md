 Today, I continued my research on the three main types of noise that can interfere with muscle signal models: baseline wander noise, Gaussian noise, and motion artifacts. I explored how each noise type affects the quality of  EMG signals and the performance of our model. Baseline wander noise, often caused by slow movements or electrode shifts, introduces low-frequency drift that can distort muscle signal patterns. Gaussian noise, which results    from electronic interference, adds random fluctuations that blur important features. Motion artifacts, typically caused by sudden body movements or poor electrode contact, create irregular spikes in the signal. All three      types of noise, if not properly addressed, reduce the accuracy and reliability of the model. This research helped me understand the importance of effective preprocessing and filtering techniques to improve signal clarity and  model performance.
