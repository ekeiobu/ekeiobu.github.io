what_i_learned: |
  I learn what Git and GitHub were, I created my first website, and it was pretty exciting. I also took a placement test, which I did poorly on because I do not know anything about Python, but I am looking to learn.
  We also had a segment for speed networking, where we got to learn and know more about our teammates and every other student in the program. For that segment, we had a bingo card and we tried to figure out who matched the description on it.


blockers: |
  I encountered an error when creating my website, but was able to sort that out after looking and comparing my work out

reflection: |
  It was a great learning experience
