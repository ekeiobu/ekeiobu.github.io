what_i_learned: |
 Today was another productive and exciting day on the team. We continued working on transferring information to Overleaf for our project, getting closer to seeing the full report come together. The more we organize the          content, the more everything is beginning to take shape.


blockers: |
   One of the small challenges we faced today was figuring out how to create hyperlinks on the Overleaf platform. We haven’t quite figured it out yet, but we’re working on it and should have it sorted soon.

reflection: |
   Nothing much to reflect on today.
