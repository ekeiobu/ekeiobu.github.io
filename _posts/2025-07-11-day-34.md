what_i_learned: |
 Today, our team delivered a video presentation as part of our ongoing project. My focus was on expanding the research gap section. I made sure to clearly outline the missing links in current studies and how our work            contributes to filling those gaps. Additionally, I incorporated recent developments involving Artificial Intelligence in ECG (electrocardiogram) analysis, which helped strengthen the relevance and innovation of our research.

  I also revised the structure of our writing to improve the overall flow and clarity. This involved reorganizing some sections to better align with the narrative of our study and ensure that each part logically builds on the   previous one.
