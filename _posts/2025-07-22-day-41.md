what_i_learned: |
 We started the day with a team meeting alongside our professor to align on next steps. After the meeting, we brainstormed ideas for our elevator pitch. I revised the script based on the feedback we shared, then proceeded to   shoot the video. Once filming was done, I took the lead on editing the final version.

reflection: |
  Today was focused and productive. We started with a team meeting with our professor which helped us clarify our direction. After that, we brainstormed ideas for our elevator pitch. I made some edits to the script based on     the feedback we shared, then recorded the video. Once I was done filming, I went ahead and edited the final version. Overall it was a good day. Seeing the idea go from rough notes to a finished product felt really satisfying.
