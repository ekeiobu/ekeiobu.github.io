what_i_learned: |
  Today, I continued reviewing research on AI and ECG. I paid close attention to what each paper focused on, the techniques they applied, and the outcomes they achieved. While some studies used deep learning, others explored     combinations like wavelet transforms with neural networks.

   This process is helping me see the bigger picture of what’s been done and what still needs to be explored. The more I read, the clearer it becomes where our project can offer something different instead of repeating existing work.

  It’s a slow process, but it’s worth it. I’m gaining valuable insight into how researchers approach problems and present their findings.

   No major blockers today

reflection: |
   Spending time reading other people’s research today reminded me that every good project starts with understanding what’s already out there. At first, it felt repetitive, but as I read more, I started connecting ideas and      noticing patterns. I saw how different teams approached the same problem in unique ways, and that opened my mind to new possibilities.
   It also made me realize how important it is to not just build something, but to build something meaningful—something that adds value. The process is slow, but I can feel myself growing. I’m not just reading to finish—I’m      reading to understand.
