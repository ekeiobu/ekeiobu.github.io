  Today, we had a productive team meeting with our professor where we discussed the next steps for our research project. The conversation helped clarify our goals and align our focus as a team. After the meeting, I dedicated    more time to research and made meaningful additions to my section of the research paper. Each step brings us closer to building a solid and impactful project.

reflection: |
   Today’s meeting with our professor was a reminder of how important it is to stay aligned as a team. Talking through our next steps helped me see the bigger picture and where my individual contributions fit in. After the       meeting, I felt more focused and motivated to continue my research. Adding new insights to my section of the paper made me realize how much progress I’ve made, and how every small piece of work is building toward             something greater.
