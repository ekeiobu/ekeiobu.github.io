what_i_learned: |
  Today was all about preparation and progress. Our team took a big step forward by practicing our presentation with our high school teacher. It was helpful to get early feedback and have the chance to sharpen how we            communicate our ideas. Speaking the content out loud made me realize what parts need to be clearer and what slides need better flow.

  I also worked on polishing our PowerPoint slides—making sure the visuals match our message and everything looks clean and professional. A lot of effort went into choosing the right layout and making the information easy to    follow.

  Lastly, I spent time digging for more references to strengthen our research and back up the points we're making in the presentation. Each source adds more weight to our work and helps us connect our findings to what’s         already out there.

reflection: |
   Practicing today helped me see what parts of our presentation still need work. Getting feedback from our high school teacher made a difference. I also fixed up the slides to make them clearer and started finding more          references to back up our points. Step by step, it’s all coming together.
