what_i_learned: |
  Today we had a discussion about our group project and I learn that we will be using and analyzing data to come up with ways cardiovascular disease could be detected early using AI. We also dive into Python 101 today. I learned about the 3 data types used in Python, which are strings, integers, and floats. Integers and floats are under the umbrella for numbers, integers has no decimals while floats does.

reflection: |
  playing Kahoot while learning Python and also using repl helped me retain the information.
