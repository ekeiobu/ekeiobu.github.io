what_i_learned: |
 This morning, our team attended a training session led by Michael, where we learned how to properly use Overleaf for adding references to our paper. It was insightful and helped clarify some of the formatting challenges we've faced. Later in the day, I compiled all the work we’ve done so far and reorganized it for clarity and consistency. Right now, I’m waiting for everyone to contribute their individual sections so we can transfer the updated document back to Overleaf and continue refining the final draft.

   No major blockers today

reflection: |
  Today reminded me how important it is to stay organized and proactive when working in a team. Taking the initiative to compile and restructure our progress helped me see the bigger picture of what we’ve accomplished so far. Learning how to manage references on Overleaf was also a valuable skill, especially for collaborative academic writing. I’ve realized that while individual effort is key, the real progress happens when everyone contributes and stays aligned.
