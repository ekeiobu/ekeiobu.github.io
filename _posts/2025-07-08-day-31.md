what_i_learned: |
 Today we had a meeting with our professor, which helped clarify our next steps as we head toward the final stretch of the program. It was a good check-in to align expectations and make sure everyone’s on track. After that,    we started transferring information over to Overleaf, which officially kicked off the drafting phase of our final document.


blockers: |
   One of the small challenges we faced today was figuring out how to create hyperlinks on the Overleaf platform. We haven’t quite figured it out yet, but we’re working on it and should have it sorted soon.

reflection: |
   Nothing much to reflect on today, but I am just thankful for the knowledge and experience that I am gaining
