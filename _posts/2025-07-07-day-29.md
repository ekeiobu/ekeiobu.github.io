what_i_learned: |
 Today was focused and productive. I started off by checking in with my team and going over some of the feedback we got from last week. We’re not presenting this week, so most of the day was spent refining our work and making  sure everything is moving in the right direction.

 I spent time organizing files, cleaning up our shared drive, and updating notes from our last meeting. I also helped brainstorm ideas for a few upcoming tasks and supported a teammate with some revisions they were working on.

   No major blockers today

reflection: |
The program is slowly coming to an end, and it’s starting to feel real now. Today was one of those days where I could feel the shift—like we’re not in the middle of things anymore, but wrapping up.

We didn’t do anything big today, just continued reviewing our work and making sure we’re on track. Even though we’re not presenting this week, I can tell everyone’s trying to finish strong.

It’s been a good experience. I’ve learned a lot, not just from the tasks but from working with different people and seeing how everything comes together. I’m going to miss this when it’s over.
