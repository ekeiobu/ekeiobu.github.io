 As we continue working toward the literature review, our team had a discussion with the tech team to better understand the direction of their current work. One major update is the change of dataset from PTB-XL to MIT-BIH. This switch was necessary because PTB-XL, although a large dataset, was found to be imbalanced, which could negatively affect the model’s performance. MIT-BIH offers a more balanced representation, making it a more suitable choice for training and evaluation in our project.
