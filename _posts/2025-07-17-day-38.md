 As we continue working toward the literature review, our team discussed with the tech team to better understand the direction of their current work. One major update is the change from the PTB-XL dataset to the MIT-BIH dataset. This switch was necessary because PTB-XL, although a large dataset, was found to be imbalanced, which could negatively affect the model’s performance. MIT-BIH offers a more balanced representation, making it a more suitable choice for training and evaluation in our project.
